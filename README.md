# scaffold
A project scaffold for Python
## Requirements
Create A Python Scaffold
This lab demonstrates an important concept in Cloud computing, building repeatable development environments that allow for Continuous Integration and Continuous Development.

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.

cd into the projects directory:  cd /home/coder/project

Install virtualenv:  python3 -m pip install virtualenv

Create a virtualenv: /home/coder/.local/bin/virtualenv VENV

Source the virtualenv (activate it):  source VENV/bin/activate

cd into scaffold:  cd /home/coder/project/scaffold

install software:  make install

Run lint:  make lint

rRun tests:  make test

Experiment on your own with breaking a test or adding a bad variable and run make lint or make test.

Note: We recommend that you open this notebook in the most updated version Google Chrome for the most consistent experience.

  
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa  
cat /home/ec2-user//.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# the string is within the public key section of the image below
# touch file_name
# make lint
```

### new task
Continuous Delivery with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Specific instructions for the project
In this project, your goal is to build a Flask Application that is Continuously Deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.


The best way to 
use this repo
 is to "fork it", delete the .elasticbeanstalk directory and replace it with yours generated by the eb init. Also, change the buildspec.yml file eb deploy command to your app name.

You can refer 
to the tutorial here as well for Flask EB
.

A.  Check out this repo and cd into it

B.  Create a python virtualenv and source it and run make all

python3 -m venv ~/.eb
source ~/.eb/bin/activate
make all

Note, that awsebcli is installed via requirements

C. Initialize new eb app

eb init -p python-3.7 flask-continuous-delivery --region us-east-1

Optional eb init again to create ssh keys

D. Create remote eb instance

eb create flask-continuous-delivery-env

E.  Setup AWS Code Build Project

Your Tasks
Create a Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.

Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.

(Optional) Share your portfolio project on Social Media with the hashtag: #duke-cloud-computing-for-data.

Sample Deliverables
Demo video. Here is a good example of an 
Elastic Beanstalk Walkthrough deployment
.

GitHub repo. Here is a 
complete example of the GitHub repo
 you can build with the YouTube Video inside.
